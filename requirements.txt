# UltraCrypto Framework Dependencies
# Minimal dependencies for demonstration purposes

# Core Python libraries (standard library - no external dependencies needed)
# The UltraCrypto Framework is designed to be dependency-free for maximum compatibility

# For demonstration and testing only:
hashlib  # Built-in Python module
time     # Built-in Python module  
random   # Built-in Python module
datetime # Built-in Python module

# Optional dependencies for enhanced features:
# numpy>=1.21.0        # For advanced mathematical operations (optional)
# matplotlib>=3.5.0    # For performance visualization (optional)
# cryptography>=3.4.0  # For additional cryptographic primitives (optional)

# Note: The core UltraCrypto algorithms are implemented using only
# Python standard library to ensure maximum portability and security.
# External dependencies are optional and only used for enhanced features.
